## üöÄ How It Works
This project presents a **speedometer system** utilizing STM32F407 for efficient data transmission, processing, and real-time speed calculation.

1. **System Architecture:**
   - The system involves **two STM32 boards**:
     - **First STM Board (Sensor Board)**:
       - Collects data from two **IR sensors** placed at a fixed distance.
       - Calculates the time difference between sensor activations.
       - Transmits the data to the **Second STM Board** via **CAN Bus**.
     - **Second STM Board (Processing & Display Board)**:
       - Receives time data from the first board.
       - Processes the speed using predefined formulas.
       - Displays the calculated speed on the **serial terminal (UART)**.
2. **Speed Alerts:**
   - If the vehicle is **below 40 km/h**, a **green LED** is activated (safe speed).
   - If the vehicle exceeds **40 km/h**, a **red LED** and **buzzer** are activated to alert the driver.
